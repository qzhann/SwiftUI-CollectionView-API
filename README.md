# SwiftUI-CollectionView-API
A Custom SwiftUI wrapper API for `UICollectionView`. Significantly simplifies the usage of [UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/220/) and [UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/215/) with the custom built view modifier that works on any SwiftUI `View`.

This is a very interesting practice for me before SwiftUI `Grid` is introduced in WWDC 2020. I get to understand more fundamental design considerations of SwiftUI when comparing with the `Grid` API.
